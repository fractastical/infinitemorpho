# Infinite Morphospace

This repository is a collection of Python scripts for simulating and visualizing concepts in morphogenesis and theoretical biology. The scripts explore reaction-diffusion systems, procedural shape generation, and classic models from the field.

## New and PlanformDB-related

*   [`planformDB_parser.py`](./planformDB_parser.py): Utilities to read a local PlanformDB SQLite/EDB file and extract yearly time series:
    - Experiments per year (via `Experiment → Publication.Year`)
    - Publications per year
    - Distinct morphologies observed per year (frequency > 0)
    Produces a merged, gap-filled `pandas.DataFrame` and a quick `matplotlib` plot. Set `DB_PATH` at the top of the script to your `.edb` file path and run the script to print summary rows and show the timeline.
*   [`basic-plan.py`](./basic-plan.py): Minimal, dependency-light generator for a planarian-like 2D outline with tapered tail, flared head auricles, mid-body bulge, and eye spots. Good for quick static silhouettes or parameter sweeps.

### Usage (PlanformDB)

- __Install deps__ (sqlite3 is in the Python stdlib):
  
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib
  ```

- __Set the database path__ at the top of `planformDB_parser.py`:
  
  ```python
  # planformDB_parser.py
  DB_PATH = "/absolute/path/to/planformDB_2.5.0.edb"
  ```

- __Run__ and view the timeline plot and printed head/tail of the table:
  
  ```bash
  python planformDB_parser.py
  ```
  
  You should see a Matplotlib window with yearly curves and console output of the first/last rows.

#### Example Output

The parser produces a timeline like this (experiments/year, publications/year, and cumulative morphologies):

![PlanformDB timeline: experiments, publications, and cumulative morphologies](planformdb_timeline.png)

To save the figure to disk instead of (or in addition to) showing it, you can add this before `plt.show()` in `plot_time_series()` or run it interactively:

```python
plt.savefig("planformdb_timeline.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")
```

## Scripts

*   [`thompson-1917.py`](./thompson-1917.py): A simple demonstration of D'Arcy Thompson's theory of transformations, showing how one shape can be deformed into another.
*   [`turing-morpho.py`](./turing-morpho.py): A simulation of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model, which generates classic Turing patterns like spots and stripes.
*   [`raup.py`](./raup.py): Implements Raup's classic model of shell coiling, generating a variety of 3D shell forms.
*   [`Cervera–Levin–Mafe.py`](./Cervera–Levin–Mafe.py): A reaction-diffusion demo inspired by Cervera–Levin–Mafe (2021), exploring morphogen antagonism and its effect on pattern formation.
*   [`morpho-range.py`](./morpho-range.py): Generates a grid of abstract shapes by sweeping through a morphospace of reaction-diffusion parameters.
*   [`planarian-morphogen.py`](./planarian-morphogen.py): Simulates the generation of a planarian body shape, including eyes and pharynx, from underlying morphogen gradients. Can produce an animated GIF of the process.
*   [`levin-pkg.py`](./levin-pkg.py): An incomplete script intended to build an interactive knowledge graph of Michael Levin's work.
*   [`planformDB_parser.py`](./planformDB_parser.py): Parse and plot PlanformDB yearly statistics (set `DB_PATH` before running).
*   [`basic-plan.py`](./basic-plan.py): Quick static planarian silhouette generator with eyes.

## Visuals

This repository also contains two GIFs generated by the scripts:

*   `planarian_morphogens.gif`: An animation showing the development of a planarian's shape based on morphogen gradients.
*   `turing_patterns.gif`: An animation of Turing patterns emerging from a reaction-diffusion system.
*   Other scripts (e.g., `planarian-morphogen.py`) can generate animations when run with GIF export enabled.
