# Infinitemorpho

This repository is a collection of Python scripts for simulating and visualizing concepts in morphogenesis and theoretical biology. The scripts explore reaction-diffusion systems, procedural shape generation, and classic models from the field.

## Scripts

*   [`thompson-1917.py`](./thompson-1917.py): A simple demonstration of D'Arcy Thompson's theory of transformations, showing how one shape can be deformed into another.
*   [`turing-morpho.py`](./turing-morpho.py): A simulation of the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model, which generates classic Turing patterns like spots and stripes.
*   [`raup.py`](./raup.py): Implements Raup's classic model of shell coiling, generating a variety of 3D shell forms.
*   [`Cervera–Levin–Mafe.py`](./Cervera–Levin–Mafe.py): A reaction-diffusion demo inspired by Cervera–Levin–Mafe (2021), exploring morphogen antagonism and its effect on pattern formation.
*   [`morpho-range.py`](./morpho-range.py): Generates a grid of abstract shapes by sweeping through a morphospace of reaction-diffusion parameters.
*   [`planarian-morphogen.py`](./planarian-morphogen.py): Simulates the generation of a planarian body shape, including eyes and pharynx, from underlying morphogen gradients. Can produce an animated GIF of the process.
*   [`levin-pkg.py`](./levin-pkg.py): An incomplete script intended to build an interactive knowledge graph of Michael Levin's work.

## Visuals

This repository also contains two GIFs generated by the scripts:

*   `planarian_morphogens.gif`: An animation showing the development of a planarian's shape based on morphogen gradients.
*   `turing_patterns.gif`: An animation of Turing patterns emerging from a reaction-diffusion system.
